# 🚀 C++ OOP & Engineering Fundamentals

### 🎯 Objective
This repository is dedicated to mastering **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **Memory Management**, and **Data Structures** using C++. As an **Android & AI Engineer**, my goal is to sharpen low-level engineering skills and understand how memory works under the hood (essential for NDK & Performance Optimization).

## 🏆 Featured Projects

### 1. 🚘 Smart Autonomous Fleet System (Tesla Style)
**Focus:** *Memory Management & Polymorphism*
A simulation of a futuristic vehicle rental system.
* **Technical Highlights:**
    * Implemented **Deep Copy Constructor** to handle dynamic battery arrays on the Heap.
    * Used **Virtual Destructors** to prevent memory leaks during polymorphic deletion.
    * Solved **Diamond Problem** using Virtual Inheritance.

### 2. 🎖️ Commando Survival Mission
**Focus:** *Abstraction & Inter-Object Communication*
A survival game engine where items affect the player's state.
* **Technical Highlights:**
    * **Dependency Injection:** Passed the `Commando` object pointer into `GameItem` classes to modify state dynamically.
    * **Abstract Base Class:** Created a strict contract for all game items (`Medkit`, `Poison`, `SuperSerum`) using Pure Virtual Functions.
    * **Runtime Polymorphism:** Stored different item types in a single `GameItem*` array and executed logic dynamically.
